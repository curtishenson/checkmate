Quick Setup Instructions --


Using Checkmate is fairly straightforward, but there are a few things that need to be done to get the most out of the theme.

Obviously the first step is to activate the theme. Don't worry if the preview looks a little funky right now, you'll need to edit some options before it is fully functional.

After the theme is activated, click on "Checkmate Theme Options". You'll be greeted with the new theme options page, if you want to jump straight to looking at the theme, scroll to the bottom and select "Save changes". This will set up the defaults for the Checkmate theme. You will now have the basic structure of Checkmate setup and ready for content!!!!
